# ft_ls

The aim of this project is to recode the system’s command 'ls' function.

Its behavior is identical to the original 'ls' command with the following variations:
◦ Available options: -l, -R, -a, -r , -t, -S, -T.
◦ The overall display, depending on each option, is staying as identical as possible
to the system command.
